<h2 id="getting-back-into-my-projects">Getting back into my projects</h2>
<p>Over the past several months I&#39;ve outlined a few software / computer science-y projects I want to do. As I perenially suffer from &quot;jack of all trades&quot; syndrome, I haven&#39;t made much progress on any, as I keep finding new things to read about and feel excited about and have a hard time sticking with one thing for a while. The goal of this blog post is simply to reconsolidate my project ideas.</p>
<h3 id="languages-i-want-to-learn">Languages I want to learn</h3>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>Common Lisp</li>
<li>Go</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these three languages, the &quot;practical&quot; choice in terms of career advancement, living in the &quot;now&quot; etc. would be Go.</p>
<p>However, for better or worse, &quot;practical&quot; isn&#39;t always very high on my list of things I care about.</p>
<p>C and Lisp are both super interesting to me in terms of their historical significance and the potential impact that learning them will have on the way I think, and the way that I program in &quot;practical&quot; languages.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been <strong>very</strong> slowly working through both <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> and <a href="https://www.gopl.io">The Go Programming Language</a> and have been enjoying both a lot. Both very very high quality textbooks on software and programming in general, beyond their specific subject matter.</p>
<h3 id="projects-i-want-to-do">Projects I want to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write a Markdown parser</li>
<li>Implement a hash table structure from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve blogged a bit about trying to do the hash table in C. I think this is still a good goal. My data structures course at Brooklyn College wasn&#39;t very good and it was a long time ago, so I think it&#39;s worth giving myself data structures homework, and giving myself practice in building something &quot;real&quot; in C at the time time. It could be cool to reimplement my hash table structure in Go once I&#39;m done, too. </p>
<p>The Markdown parser, on the other hand, I think would be a good project to do in Lisp. I read somewhere that Lisps are good for implementing recursive descent parsers, which makes intuitive sense to me, I think.</p>
<p>A fun incentive for completing the Markdown parser is that I will be able to replace <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a> with my own parser in my <a href="http://davep3rrett.info/posts/2018-10-30-makefile-static-blog-generator.html">static site generator</a> that powers this very blog!! I will feel the power of my code that much more, every time I rebuild my blog. Awesome.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Anyway, that&#39;s it. This was just a quick post to recap what I want to do in my free time / self-study time over the next couple of months. Hopefully this will be useful in holding myself accountable and getting myself to actually do stuff! See you next time.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to my first programming blog post in more than two years! After a year of doing lots of front end web development work, my itch to do computer science-y, Unix greybeard-y things has intensified.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to learn Vim forever (I spent some time in Emacs a couple years ago, but finally gave it up, as I was stagnating at a level of ability that wasn&#39;t high enough for real productivity, and suffering from a lack of desire to continue down that particular rabbit hole, for whatever reason) - and I&#39;ve actually finally begun learning it!</p>
<p>I&#39;m typing this post in Vim, have been forcing myself to use it at work for small / quick code edits, have added a bit to my <code>.vimrc</code> and have started using a plugin manager (I went with <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> although I see that <a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a> also seem to have some serious devotees).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been wanting to learn to program meaningfully in C - I&#39;ve decided to finally sit down and chug through Zed Shaw&#39;s <a href="https://learncodethehardway.org/c/">Learn C The Hard Way</a>. After buying the course and checking out a couple of the videos, I noticed that Zed edits in Vim in the videos. This was an added impetus for me to learn Vim and also made it feel like C programming and Vim probably go hand-in-hand (at least maybe moreso than zillion-file Node.js ecosystem frontend web framework hellscape projects and Vim).</p>
<p>Lastly, I was just recently thinking that implementing a data structure like a hashmap / associative array would be a cool non-trivial C project to attempt. It would up my (currently very weak) data structures game, cause me to learn about different hashing functions, and most definitely level up my C abilities.</p>
<p>After a bit of searching, I found this nicely written up <a href="https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table">tutorial</a>. My plan right now is to not directly follow this tutorial, and purposely not really read it unless I&#39;m really stuck on something. I think it will be more valuable / educational / impression-making on me if I do the fumbling and scrounging for resources on the various disciplines required for the project on my own, and then synthesize my findings on my own. But I will keep the aforementioned guide handy in case I&#39;m stuck or want to cross-reference something I&#39;m doing against how the tutorial author did it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m calling this post a &#39;preamble&#39; in addition to calling it a &#39;ramble&#39; because I want to use it to kick off what will be a series of subsequent posts about my findings as I dive into this project / amalgamation of sub-projects.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it! See you next post (hopefully before two more years from now)!</p>
